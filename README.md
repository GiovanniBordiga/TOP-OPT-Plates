# TOP-OPT-Plates
MATLAB Code for Topology Optimization of Plates

<add nice image>

## Overview
This is a project developed by a small group of students of the *University of Trento (Italy)* for the *Computational Mechanics of Structures 2* course.

The aim is to explore the topology optimization area by embedding its techniques into a structural application.

## Features
The main functionalities implemented in the code are
- *Compliance Optimization* (work of loads minimization)
- *Eigenfrequencies Optimization*
- Different types of finite element available (ACM, MBF, etc.)
- Plots displaying *convergence*, *deformed configuration* and *eigenmodes*

## Future development
Possibly some of these areas may be explored and developed in the future
- *Multiobjective Optimization* (for compliance problems)
- *Band Gap Optimization*
- Performance improvements through *numerical integration*
- Other optimization methods such as the *Method of Moving Asymptotes* (MMA)
